Instructions for use:
    Run the code in the file "EmployeeSQL/code_and_query/table_creation.sql" in PGAdmin.  \
    Once the tables are created, you are going to import the data to the tables from the CSV files.  \
    You need to do so in the following order:  \
        1. departments table from departments.csv \
        2. titles table from titles.csv \
        3. employees table from employees.csv \
        4. salaries table from salaries.csv \
        5. dept_emp table from dept_emp.csv \
        6. dept_manager table from dept_manager.csv \
    Now you can begin querying. All queries are nested in the "EmployeeSQL/code_and_query/query.sql" file. \
    Run each query individually to retain the results.  \
